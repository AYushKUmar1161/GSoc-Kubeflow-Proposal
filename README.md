# Project Title
Batch Processing Gateway Integration for Optimized Spark Job Execution in Kubeflow

## Summary
The rapid growth in the scale of data processing and machine learning workloads has led to an increasing demand for efficient, scalable, and flexible systems capable of handling complex, distributed jobs across cloud-based environments. Kubeflow, as a robust cloud-native platform for managing machine learning (ML) workflows, plays a key role in providing this capability. However, despite its strengths, there are still challenges around effectively running Spark jobs within the Kubeflow ecosystem, particularly at scale, and ensuring that resources are optimally allocated across clusters.

This project seeks to address these challenges by integrating the Batch Processing Gateway (BPG) with Kubeflow for the submission, management, and monitoring of Spark jobs across multiple Kubernetes clusters. The BPG offers a centralized approach to managing job submissions, routing, and monitoring, which is critical in a multi-cluster environment where resource allocation, scaling, and load balancing are crucial for ensuring that jobs are executed efficiently and on time.

The primary objective is to enhance the Kubeflow platform by implementing a dynamic job routing system that ensures Spark jobs are distributed intelligently across available clusters based on factors like resource availability, load, and priority. This would allow workloads to scale seamlessly without manual intervention, which is essential for large-scale data processing tasks typically encountered in machine learning workflows.

Another key goal of the project is to develop a Python SDK tailored for Kubeflow Notebooks, enabling data scientists and ML engineers to seamlessly submit, manage, and monitor Spark jobs directly from the notebook interface. By utilizing the BPG’s RESTful APIs, this SDK will provide an intuitive interface that abstracts away complex operations, making it easier for users to interact with the platform and streamline their workflows.

A critical aspect of this project is the integration of debugging and performance monitoring capabilities, which will allow users to visualize Spark job progress, track execution metrics, and identify performance bottlenecks. The integration of Spark’s UI into Kubeflow will enable users to view job DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) and task execution stages in real-time, while Prometheus-based monitoring will provide centralized logging and performance tracking. These features will empower users to quickly identify issues and optimize their workloads for better efficiency.

Lastly, comprehensive documentation and user guides will be developed to ensure that users can easily adopt and effectively leverage the new features. This will include detailed instructions for setting up the integration, submitting jobs via the SDK, monitoring job progress, and troubleshooting common issues. The goal is to empower data scientists, ML engineers, and other Kubeflow users to harness the full potential of the platform and improve their workflows.

In summary, this project aims to address several critical gaps in the Kubeflow ecosystem by providing seamless, automated job routing, improving job monitoring and debugging capabilities, and enhancing user experience through intuitive APIs. The successful completion of this project will significantly enhance the scalability, usability, and efficiency of Spark job execution within the Kubeflow platform, enabling users to work with large-scale datasets and ML models more effectively.

## Qualifications; Motivation?
I am currently a third-year BTech student with a solid academic background in computer science, specializing in full-stack development, cloud technologies, and distributed systems. Over the course of my studies, I have honed my skills in various programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript, along with extensive experience working with modern frameworks such as React, Flask, and Django. I have also worked on projects that involve managing databases, optimizing backend services, and integrating front-end and back-end systems. This has provided me with a strong foundation in building scalable, high-performance applications.

Beyond my academic coursework, I have actively worked on multiple personal and academic projects related to cloud computing and distributed systems, which gives me a clear understanding of the challenges and complexities involved in managing large-scale data processing workflows. For example, I have developed a desktop application for food ordering, billing, and management using Python, MySQL, and Tkinter. This project, while primarily focused on small-scale data management, allowed me to delve deeply into how backend systems can be optimized for efficiency.

I have contributed to open-source projects in the past, and I believe in the power of collaborative development. For instance, I have been involved in a hackathon project where we designed an AI-powered personalized e-commerce recommendation system, leveraging data science principles and AI algorithms to optimize product recommendations. This project improved my ability to work with large datasets and sharpened my skills in machine learning, both of which are highly relevant for this project, especially considering the large-scale workloads typically handled by Spark.

The motivation for me to work on this project comes from my passion for distributed systems, cloud-native technologies, and the growing need for scalable, high-performance platforms for machine learning and big data processing. Kubeflow and Spark, when integrated correctly, provide the potential for simplifying and optimizing data processing workflows in ways that would benefit a wide range of users, from researchers to enterprise ML engineers.

I am excited to work on this project because it allows me to dive deeper into Kubeflow, Kubernetes, and Spark, all of which are technologies that I am passionate about. By integrating the Batch Processing Gateway (BPG) with Kubeflow for Spark job management, I would be helping make it easier for teams to run Spark workloads at scale, optimizing the entire data pipeline, and contributing to a critical problem that many machine learning practitioners face: efficient resource management and job scheduling at scale.

Furthermore, the challenge of automating job routing and improving debugging and monitoring features is something I am eager to tackle. I am particularly interested in designing a user-friendly Python SDK for interacting with Kubeflow Notebooks, as this will allow me to explore how to balance complex technical requirements with an intuitive user experience. This project aligns perfectly with my goal of building scalable and efficient systems that provide real-world value.

I am highly motivated to contribute to this project because it will not only enhance my understanding of cloud-native systems and distributed data processing but will also allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the Kubeflow community. This project presents an opportunity to learn from experienced mentors, collaborate with like-minded individuals, and contribute to the open-source ecosystem, which is something I am deeply passionate about.

Availability: I can fully commit to this project during the GSoC period and can dedicate 30-35 hours per week to the work. I am free from any major academic commitments during this time, which means I will be able to devote my full attention to this project. I have the organizational skills to balance this work with any additional personal or academic projects I may have.
